## Learnings

- Makefile system determines whether a file changed based solely upon timestamp
    - If A depends on B, and A is older than B, guess what - A's gettin' made, babe.
- First rule is the one run by default; by convention, this should be the `all` command
- Similarly, Makefiles typically include a `clean` command
- Each rule follows the pattern `<TARGET_FILE>: <DEPENDENCY>`
- Obviously, if a target file does not exist, then the commands for that rule get executed
    - This is why `all` typically does not output to any file
- Makefiles require tabs, not spaces
